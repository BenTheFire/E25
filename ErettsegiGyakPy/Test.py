Dictionaries:
    A dictionary is a_esemeny collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and maps to a_esemeny value.
    Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can change their content after creation.

    Usage of dictionary:
    - Storing data in a_esemeny structured way
    - Fast lookups by key
    - Associating values with unique keys
    - Representing JSON-like structures
    - Counting occurrences of items
    - Grouping related data together

    Limitations of dictionary:
    - Keys must be immutable types (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples)
    - Cannot use mutable types (e.g., lists) as keys
    - Order of keys is not guaranteed (prior to Python 3.7, but now insertion order is preserved)

    When to use dictionary?
    - When you need to associate values with unique keys
    - Class Representation
    - When you need fast lookups by key

    Example:
    - Storing student grades: {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 90, "Charlie": 78}
